					<h1>About</h1>
				
					<p>Hey Crochet! was founded in 2021 as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. We saw the response the pandemic had on everyone and their new amount of time at home. We wanted to help people gain a new hobbie and skill to take up their time and relieve some stress.</p>
			  
                    <p>Some may say that crocheting is only for certain people, but we disagree with that entirely! Crocheting is a hobbie for everyone and anyone who wants to create something from scratch out of yarn and hooks. We welcome beginners to advanced individuals, anyone of any gender identification, and all ages to our site. </p>

					<h1>Lessons</h1>
				    
					<p>Crocheting is a hobby that involves yarn and crocheting hooks. Similar to knitting, crocheting is the weaving of yarn through stitches to form anything you want. It is important to note however, there are differences between knitting and crocheting.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here are the list of differences:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Crocheting uses hooks, not needles.</li>
                        <li>Knitting uses two needles. Crocheting only requires one hook to be used.</li>
                        <li>Types of stitches</li>
                        <li>Patterns made will be different between knitting and crocheting due to terminology and order.</li>
                    </ol>
                
                    <h2>Lesson 1: Materials</h2>
                    
                    <p>Anyone can crochet with the proper materials. Two key materials is yarn and crocheting hooks. You may have other materials as well, such as a yarn needle to weave excess yarn into the stitching.</p>
                
                    <p>There are different weights to yarn. The way to identify the different weights is typically through these symbols.</p>
                    
                    <p>[Symbols of yarn weights in order of thinnest to thickest yarn.]</p>
                
                    <p>It's also important to note that there are different hook sizes. Hook sizes are usually identified by letters, such as H or J. They are also represent by numerical values in mm units.</p>

                    <h2>Lesson 2: Basics</h2>
                
                    <p>To start off, you will need to know the basics of crocheting. You will learn how to identify what is a chain, stitch, and yarn over.</p>

                    <h3>Coasters</h3>
                
					<p>For this pattern you will need a G size crocheting hook and your choice of medium, or worsted, yarn. Choice of color is also up to you!</p>
                
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make a slip knot and insert crocheting hook into loop.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over and pull yarn through the hoop to make a chain.</li>
                        <li>Continue making chains until you count to 30.</li>
                        <li>Chain 1 more and then insert the hook into the closest chain while keeping your loop on the hook.</li>
                        <li>Yarn over until you have two loops on the hook. Yarn over again and pull through both loops to make a single crochet.</li>
                        <li>Continue making single crochets down the row.</li>
                        <li>Chain 1 and turn piece over. Single crochet into the closest stitch.</li>
                        <li>Continue making single crocheting down the rows. Repeat for the next 20 rows.</li>
                        <li>Once you are done, cut the yarn a few inches from your current stitch. Pull yarn through the loop and tie a knot. Congrats on making a coaster!</li>
