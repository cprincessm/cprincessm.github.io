                <h2>A Second Chance for Book-to-Screen Adaptation</h2>

                <p>
                    The popular <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i> series by Rick Riordan has recently been picked up by Disney+ for a streaming series adapation. News of the agreement was announced mid-May on Rick Riordan's official social media pages.

                     With Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox studios, the rights for <i>the Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i> movies shifted to Disney in early 2019. The acquisition of the series sparked fans interest and hopes that a better movie is to come. Initial conversations between the author and the behemoth entertain studios began last year in 2019. Rick Riordan posted an image of himself with a badge featuring Disney+'s logo. Not much was said with the image, but fans went crazy. This led to the hashtag #DisneyAdaptPercyJackson to trend on Twitter.

                <p>
                    No news on the potential series or adaptation was mentioned after the December meeting until the official announcement on Rick Riordan's social media pages in May 2020. The official announcement brings excitement, but also worry to fans.

                    Book-to-Screen adapations are commonplace in the entertainment industry. Many other book series have also been adapted, such as <i>The Hunger Games, Harry Potter,</i> and <i>Crazy Rich Asians.</i> All of the these books were adapted to films. <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i> also had its shot at a big-screen film adaptation. However, the film did not do the book series justice and received many criticisms as a result. Despite the negative reviews, a sequel film was made for the series, which sadly did even worse than the first.

                    With such a poor adaptation of the movies, fans are concerned that there would a continuation of the terrible movies. Those worries were put to rest as Riordan officially said that it would be a television series adaption with Riordan being an large role in the process. This brought hope and excitement to fans that the books will finally get to see a proper adaptation of the Greek mythology series.

                    However, being that this is the second attempt at turning the Greek mythology fictional series to a screen adaptation, fans are still a little skeptical. Due to this, Riordan and his wife, Becky Riordan, have been reaching out to fans constantly to see what is important to series. Fans have consistently mentioned the importance of properly aged young actors, diversity in the roles, LGBTQ+ representation, and more for the series.

                    The Disney+ series has no set release date at this point since they are in the early phases of production. With COVID-19 still affecting a large part of the United States, the entertainment industry has been put on hold for the past few months and will unlikely be resuming anytime soon. That being said, the progress on the series may be slow for the foreseeable future.
